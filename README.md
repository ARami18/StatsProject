# StatsProject

A C++17 console app that compiles the following stats on a list of real numbers.

Number of values: The count of elements in the dataset 

Minimum value: The value that is less than or equal to all values in the set

Maximum value: The value that is greater than or equal to all values in the set

Range: The range of values in the dataset

Statistical median: The middle value of a sorted data set of odd length, or the arithmetic mean of the two closest values to the middle of a sorted data set of even length

Arithmetic mean: The sum of all the values divided by the number of values

Variance: The mean of the squared differences of each sample from the arithmetic mean.

Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance
